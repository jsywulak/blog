a flow chart for whether or not you should do something with jira

    is it just a virtual representation of post its on a wall
            |                                   |
            v                                   v
    don't do this with jira.            do this with jira.


I have a lot of neo-luddite opinions but the one that remote working ruins the most is that the apex project management technique is just _post its on a wall_.

* Have a list of things you need to do? Post its on a wall near your desk.
* Have a list of things that a team of people need to do? Post its on a wall that is near the team.
* Need to make it clear what things are in progress, blocked, and complete? Post its in columns on a wall.
* Need to keep force your task decomposition to a point where work items can be actioned within a day or so? You can only write so much on a post it. 
* Finding yourself with a huge backlog that you'll never do? Not with post its on a wall, because you only have so much wall. 

Never have you been unable to move a post it to another part of the wall because it didn't have a specific field filled out. Never has anyone ever asked you to align your post it on a wall to another, bigger postit on another wall in a room you can't see. 

I enjoy hating on jira projects as much as the next person, but even the good work management tools are too too much. Github is convienient, Linear is beautiful, but I will always choose post its on a wall over any of them. 

The fatal flaw of post its on a wall, however, is that you need to share a physical space. When the team is not physically colocated daily, post its on a wall breaks down. Even if you have a live stream of the wall, remote observers can't move post its or put notes on them, nuetering them of their supeririorty.

If your team is physically spread out, you're stuck using one of these tools. My advice to making them effective is to make them work as much like post its on a wall as you can. This can be challenging, and sometimes even forbidden, in large corporate environments. One of the advantages of working as a contractor is you can always plead ignorance of corporate norms, but a fun fact is you can also do this even if your a full-time employee and it'll work most of the time.

* Only use the "title" field of the virtual card -- this keeps you limited to what you can write because even if the field is unlimited text, only so much will show up on the board view.
* If your company's setup requires text in certain fields, use passages from Moby Dick, so at least something of cultural value will live in your company's jira.
* If your company requires some weird heirarchy of issue types, there's always a bottom-level type that you can just assign everything a static parent. 
* 

WIP limits are critical but they're useless if their articically enforced by your tooling. Whatever your team thinks if the WIP limit for your team needs to be enforced by cultural norms -- otherwise no matter how fancy your jira board is set up, people will work on things that are incorrect states.
